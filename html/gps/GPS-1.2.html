<!-- Article: like the article of a newspaper
Section: like a chapter in a book... usually has a header
Div: if no other semantic tag works, use a div... or just use a div for CSS styling to target a specific group of things (called a "hook")
Nav: grouping together multiple links... like a navigation bar
aside: content not needed to understand the main content... quote, footnote, advertisement...
header and footer are constant on every page (like the side grey bar on the DBC portal)
header: logo for website, nav bar, account info...
footer: information that's on every page but not as important... legal, contact us, job offerings -->

<!-- Reflection, Release 4
1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
Semantic tags tells the browser and the reader the meaning of the content that follows.

2.Which ones do you see as most useful?
Out of the ones discussed today, I find the section tag to be incredibly useful in dividing up the content into organized sections. I also learned the importance of the header and footer tag today- a header has all the important content to a page (ie nav bar, home page link etc) whereas the footer would have something like a contact page or social media links. These don't necessarily appear at the top or bottom of the page, but can.

3.What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
I am not sure if I understand this question correctly. I believe the browser goes in the order of the elements displayed in the html document. But today we also discussed the order in which the semantic elements would show up on a page and it looks like this:
<body>
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<article>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>
and a close tag for all.


4.What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to make a snippet. While I look forward to creating shortcuts in the future, this GPS session took me in the opposite direction where I've decided its more beneficial in this stage to write out a lot of the code so it can help with recall and with typing speed.

5.What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Most challenging was defining the different semantic tags. The clarification on the header and footer tag helped me realize that they can show up anywhere on the page. To help improve my understanding of this I will be more observant of where that type of information lies on a page.
