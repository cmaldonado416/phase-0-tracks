# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to track changes within a given document or file. It allows for various configurations within a branch that can then be merged back into the original master file. This is useful because you can have various versions and work with multiple people, without harming the original file.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is when you duplicate a new version of the original master file which you can work off of. You can make changes within a branch without affecting the master branch. Eventually you can push those changes and create pull requests so that the changes can be merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point of a staged file. A good commit message describes what were the changes were made, or why that save point is important.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when there is a conflict with the content of the branch you are trying to merge and the version you are merging into. It could be that there is a conflict with a certain line, but at this point its important to communicate with the person who is working on the other file to decide how to resolve the the conflict.
